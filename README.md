## Introduction
Throughout the years, there are so many debates about the security in the US like why the rate of gun murders in the US was usually high compared to other developed countries or why the number of crimes happening in the US was increasing. May the explanations be the overuse of deadly weapons or that America is more prone to crimes since the differences in culture or income equality.
The narrative visualisation was designed to partly explain these problems to people who want to discover about the history and trend of crime in the US though the relation of three main issues with the serious criminal:
1. Unemployment
2. Race and Ethnicity 
3. Weapon

## Details
• Shiny R was used to make the visualisation of the project.
• Google Maps API was required to make the visualisation of the map.
• Datasets acquired from open websites on the Internet such as FBI.gov, USA.gov,...
• Datasets will need some refining, reformatting and filtering process before making
visualisations for the project.
